This repository contains the code for finding and analyzing the large scale filaments in Coma Supercluster using DisPerSE filament finder. We use HDBSCAN for clustering the galaxies belonging to dense regions. This code was used for the analysis of [Mahajan, S. Singh, A. Shobhana, D. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09029).
